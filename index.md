## Fallacy.me

This site is a collection of Mathematical fallacies & incorrect proofs. The aim of this website is to help you understand concepts better by training you to find subtle, common mistakes.

Each fallacy is accompanied by a proof that is incorrect. The goal is to find the mistake in the proof. Hints and/or solutions are provided to help you if you are stuck.

You can expand the categories on the sidebar to see all the fallacies in that category.

This site is a work in progress. If you find any mistakes or have any suggestions, please let me know at `fallacy (at) akshat.sh`.
